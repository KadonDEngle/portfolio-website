# Kadon Engle - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This site acts as a place for me to showcase some of my work and most importantly, my ADVENTURES! It felt right to build this project using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. I'm not a monster, though, so I did use **Vite** for some quality-of-life tools like hot module replacement and a streamlined build process.

The code is structured using **BEM methodology** for CSS and a **component-based JavaScript** architecture. My goal was to highlight fundamental web development skills while keeping the project lightweight and framework-free.
